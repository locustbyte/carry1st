# Carry 1st Front end Test

## To run on local machine

2. type `npm install` command on terminal
3. type `npm start` command on terminal

# Dependencies using:

Using Bootstrap for responsive grid.
https://getbootstrap.com/

Using Axios for API calls
https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios
A promise based http client for browser and nodeJS

#Hosting

1. type `npm build` command on terminal
   Which will out put a distribution production file set which you could host on most platforms.

# Performance considerations

1. I would opt for local files for the bootstrap and axios
2. I would implement a caching strategy for the application as a whole
3. Images would be SVG where possible / image maps
4. Minified scripts css etc
